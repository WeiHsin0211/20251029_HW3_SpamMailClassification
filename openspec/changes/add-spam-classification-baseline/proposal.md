## Why
Implement a baseline spam email classification system using machine learning to automatically detect and filter spam messages. This will provide the foundation for future improvements and additional ML models.

## What Changes
- Add data ingestion from CSV source
- Implement basic text preprocessing pipeline
- Create SVM-based classification model
- Add model training and evaluation functionality
- Set up basic prediction interface

## Impact
- Affected specs: ml/spam-classification
- Affected code: New module creation
- Data dependencies: External CSV dataset from GitHub

## Future Phases (Planned)
- Phase 2: [To be defined in future proposal]
- Phase 3: [To be defined in future proposal]
- Phase 4: [To be defined in future proposal]
